  I. About

    This project helps you to create high quality Puppet modules in a fast and
    comfortable way. Main targets are to boost your efficiency and Puppet code
    quality. Use it if you want to get Puppet module skeletons with:

    - tidy and easily extendable structure
    - good documentation
    - source code which follows the official style guide[1]
    - parameterized classes[2]

    Just call the "new module wizard", answer the questions and start editing.

  II. Usage

    1. Clone the repository:
       $ git clone git://github.com/bitkollektiv/puppet-boilerplate-modules.git

    2. Call the wizard to create the module skeleton for a new module:
       $ ./puppet-boilerplate-modules/newmodule.sh
       You can provide the answers by using parameters. Use "newmodule.sh -h" to
       get a listing.
