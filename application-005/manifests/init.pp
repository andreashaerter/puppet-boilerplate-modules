# == Class: boilerplate
#
# This class is able to install or remove boilerplate on a node.
#
# [Add description - What does this module do on a node?] FIXME/TODO
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#   String. Controls if the managed resources shall be <tt>present</tt> or
#   <tt>absent</tt>. If set to <tt>absent</tt>:
#   * The managed software packages are being uninstalled.
#   * Any traces of the packages will be purged as good as possible. This may
#     include existing configuration files. The exact behavior is provider
#     dependent. Q.v.:
#     * Puppet type reference: {package, "purgeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
#     * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
#   * System modifications (if any) will be reverted as good as possible
#     (e.g. removal of created users, services, changed log settings, ...).
#   * This is thus destructive and should be used with care.
#   Defaults to <tt>present</tt>.
#
# [*autoupgrade*]
#   Boolean. If set to <tt>true</tt>, any managed package gets upgraded
#   on each Puppet run when the package provider is able to find a newer
#   version than the present one. The exact behavior is provider dependent.
#   Q.v.:
#   * Puppet type reference: {package, "upgradeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
#   * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
#   Defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
#
# The default values for the parameters are set in boilerplate::params. Have
# a look at the corresponding <tt>params.pp</tt> manifest file if you need more
# technical information about them.
#
#
# === Examples
#
# * Installation:
#     class { 'boilerplate': }
#
# * Removal/decommissioning:
#     class { 'boilerplate':
#       ensure => 'absent',
#     }

  #### Manage actions

  # repository
  class { 'boilerplate::repo': }     # FIXME/TODO: Remove this declaration or this comment. See "repo.pp" for more information.

  # package(s)
  class { 'boilerplate::package': }

  # configuration
  class { 'boilerplate::config': }   # FIXME/TODO: Remove this declaration or this comment. See "config.pp" for more information.



  #### Manage relationships          # FIXME/TODO: Remove the whole relationships block if not needed

  if $ensure == 'present' {
    # we need working repositories before installing packages
    Class['boilerplate::repo'] -> Class['boilerplate::package']     # FIXME/TODO: Remove this relationship or this comment. See "repo.pp" for more information.

    # we need the software before configuring it
    Class['boilerplate::package'] -> Class['boilerplate::config']   # FIXME/TODO: Remove this relationship or this comment. See "config.pp" for more information.

  } else {
    # there is currently no need for a specific removal order
